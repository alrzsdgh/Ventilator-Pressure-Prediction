# Ventilator-Pressure-Prediction
Simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung


This repository contains a notebook in which a model is trained to predict the pressure of a patient's lung which is connected to a ventilator. A [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ventilator-pressure-prediction) was held on the Kaggle platform to help overcome the cost barrier of developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators.

## How to Run:
in order to run the notebook, the ventilator.ipynb file has to be uploaded on the colab or kaggle platform. Then by clicking on the `Run All` button, outputs will be all produced automatically. Make sure to upload [data files](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ventilator-pressure-prediction/data) in a proper directory and put `RunTime` on GPU mode! 

P.S: There is a slight error in labeling the last chart outputed in the notebook. The second chart belongs to the trained model not the naive one.
